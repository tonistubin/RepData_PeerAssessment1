# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
I started by loading the data from the file _activity.zip_ present in this folder.

```{r}
originalData <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"),header=T)
```

After this, I cleaned the resulting data set from empty (NA) values.
```{r}
cleanData <- originalData[complete.cases(originalData$steps),]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
